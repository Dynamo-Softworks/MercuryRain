At around 12:19 AM on 05/14/2015 Mercury Rain output "okay" despite no strings or printlns with those characters existing during debugging.
"OK" was being used as a debug string, however.

After modifying the tech file, the behavior stopped. Undoing said changes did not result in the phenomenon again.

Randomly happened again at 12:35
appears like:

okay
okay

with my stream of "OK"s following.
